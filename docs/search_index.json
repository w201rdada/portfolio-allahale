I am Alla Hale, and I would like to welcome you to my W201 Portfolio! Take a look around, I think you’ll enjoy reading about some of my data science ideas. I have worked on new product development in several capacities- as an engineer, as a project leader, as an experiment designer, and as a voice-of-customer gatherer. In my world, new ideas need to solve problems. The two ideas in this portfolio were born out of problems that I have encountered in my daily life. (#fig:Alla_Hale_Portfolio)Hello! Abstract of Cena Cena, a digital foodie best friend, creates custom meal plans for you. Meal plans are created with almost no effort by you and are tailored to your preferences. Cena even holds your hand at the grocery store because all meal plans come with a shopping list. Let your culinary adventure begin. Effortlessly. Hi I’m an abstract for your first big idea! Abstract of SILIKI SILIKI, or See It, Like It, Knit It, creates knitting patterns from images of knit garments. For the non-knitter, a knitting pattern is a construction recipe for an object. It tells the knitter how many stitches to cast on, how many rows to knit, how shape the fabric, and how to construct the garment. SILIKI helps the knitter to recreate garments that are spotted out in the wild by providing the knitter with a knitting pattern. About the author I am interested in the application of data science to new product ideation and development. I received my bachelor of chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota in 2010. Previously, I held roles with Nitto Denko Technical as a Materials Engineer, Kyocera America, Inc. as a Research and New Product Development Engineer. Currently, I am with Hexion as a Design for Six Sigma Black Belt. I lead new product and process development projects, driven by a strong analysis of data and utilization of six sigma methodologies. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my husband and two small, energetic children. In addition to hiking, I love playing with sticks and string (i.e. knitting). Updated: 2018-03-13 "],

The daily struggle to come up with a dinner solution is real for anyone who eats. Meal planning can help solve the problem by providing a simple plan to follow every night. But, let’s be honest, putting together a meal plan takes hours! First, you sift through the multitudes of online recipes. Next, you become overwhelmed but get to work. After several iterations you’re sweating, but you have a meal plan, and you can meticulously check ingredient lists to put together a weekly shopping list. After all that, you need a nap! Enter Cena, a foodie best friend that hands you a list of personalized recipes and guides you with a shopping list. (Nikolaus and Nickols-Richardson 2017)(Seyitoğlu 2016) 1.2 Welcome Cena, your menu navigator. Cena will scour recipe websites and deliver a personalized menu plan along with a shopping list. To get to know you, as the eater, Cena will ask about basic dietary restrictions (Vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, Kosher, Halal, etc.). Then you will get to play a quick game of “Would you rather eat this or that?”. Based on the responses to this game, and ratings by users like you, Cena will combine individual recipes and present your first meal plan. After getting to know the food preferences of those for whom you meal plan, Cena will take off scraping the web for recipes every week. Using an algorithm yet-to-be-determined(A. T. V, V, and Culture 2018), it will rank recipes, and select a handful for a complete week of meals. After you approve the suggestion, Cena will compile a shopping list based on the recipe ingredient lists. Cena practically holds your hand at the grocery store. Since Cena can access the entire internet of recipes, it is not limited in the meal plans it can create. Cena will work equally well for a single young professional or a large family with kids and grandparents, for a nutrition buff following a strict diet or a comfort food lover. Even though you may not explicitly state your food health goals, such as lowering cholesterol, Cena will soon learn them if you are honest with your feedback. Based on the meals you queue for certain evenings, Cena will learn your typical dining schedule. However, if you choose, you can let Cena know that you usually eat alone on Tuesdays, eat out on Fridays, and need to please a crowd for lunch every other Sunday. Cena will use machine learning to incorporate your ratings of individual meals and overall plans with those of similar users to carefully curate your next meal plan. Do you enjoy simple meals with few ingredients? Do you love fancy meals that wow all your guests? Do you consistently rate simple, light-colored, carb-heavy meals highly because you are a toddler? The more you use it, the better Cena will know you. Cena will balance your food preferences with your stated food aspirations. 1.3 What will you do with your free time? Over time, Cena will learn your preferences. It will plan meals that evoke your childhood or delightfully surprise you by pushing your epicurean boundaries, all while meeting your needs. Cena might miss the mark, though if it does not get accurate feedback. Though someone may want or need to limit their sodium intake, Cena cannot force them to enjoy low sodium meals. But if Cena ever gets it wrong, you can easily swap out a meal or a whole plan for something different. Best of all, it will remove the mountain of small decisions from your day, easing the decision fatigue and freeing up your time and energy to tackle the big stuff. (Tierney 2011) Bibliography "],

You see a knit garment that you must make, but without a knitting pattern**, it is difficult to recreate. For knitters, this can happen any time, anywhere. There exists an unbelievably large number of knitting patterns dispersed in knitting magazines, books, blogs, or aggregated on Ravelry. Ravelry, a social network for knitters and knitting pattern database, has been gaining membership steadily since its founding in 2007 (“How Ravelry Works” 2009) and is currently at 7.6 million registered accounts. However, there are many garments that do not have patterns because they are commercially made, designed by a single knitter with sparse notes on loose paper, or many other reasons. Sometimes, a knitter spots an item at the bus stop, in a movie, or elsewhere in the wild, and wishes to recreate it, but cannot find the pattern. A talented designer can, of course, reverse engineer most objects. However, Siliki (see it, like it, knit it) aids the knitter by automating the process of designing a knit object from a photograph. Siliki takes an image of a knit garment as input, identifies the garment, stitch pattern(s), and gauge. As an intermediate output, Siliki determines which measurements are required for the particular garment. The user inputs the required measurements, and Siliki produces a custom pattern to recreate the garment. Siliki will provide knitters with knitting patterns to recreate any garment from an image! 2.2 Here, have a pattern! How would a knitter recreate a garment if no pattern exists? There are many questions to answer. First, we must answer the obvious questions about number of stitches and stitch patterns, then the less obvious questions about best construction techniques, and then the artistic questions about the best shaping techniques for the drape of specific yarns. Figure 1. An adorable baby cardigan knit by Alla Figure 2. Another equally adorable baby cardigan knit by Alla From a user submitted photograph, like the examples above, Siliki uses image recognition along with machine learning to identify the type of garment, stitch pattern(s), gauge, and suggested yarn.*** Once Siliki knows the type of garment, it can identify the most likely construction. The critical measurements required are based on the construction of the garment. For example, a cardigan with raglan sleeves will require a bust size, length, and desired ease, while a hat would require a head circumference. Figure 3. An example of an easy to reverse engineer image Figure 4. An example of an difficult to reverse engineer image Siliki identifies the stitch patterns on the garment based on a machine learning algorithm trained on images from Ravelry’s pattern and project database. Ravelry currently contains more than 740 thousand knit and crochet patterns and 17.5 million knit and crochet projects, most with multiple images. Several examples of different images of the same cute baby pants are shown above. The challenge here will be to train the algorithm sufficiently such that it recognizes images of the stitch patterns in various yarns, colors, guages, and in very different lighting situations. For very complex stitch patterns that are extremely difficult to decipher (e.g. complex and novel lace), Siliki will default to a close, but simpler match. Once Siliki identifies the type of garment, the stitch patterns, the gauge, and receives the measurements from the user, a pattern can be built following proportional calculations for stitch counts and shaping. Some machine learning will be required here to account for the best shaping methods. Siliki will synthesize all of the output to create a beautifully formatted custom pattern. The pattern will contain information on needle sizes and recommended yarns based on suitability and popularity on Ravelry. Additionally, Siliki will output patterns that are similar to what the user is trying to create. If Ravelry contains a pattern for a very close match, a link to that pattern will be returned, with the option to purchase it or create the pattern. If the image submitted is one of the images included in an existing pattern, Siliki will not provide a pattern, but only the purchase option. If there are errors in the pattern that can be fixed by the user, they may be uploaded to Siliki’s website to inform future patterns. If the user needs help, Siliki will have talented knitwear designers to provide a fix to the user and the database. Patterns created utilizing Siliki will be copyrighted to Siliki. All copyright laws will apply.(“A Matter of Principle” 2018) 2.3 Let’s knit! Now that the user has a pattern, the knitting is up to them. Creation of the garment is still as much of an art as following any other pattern. The knitter selects the yarn, executes the swatching, knitting, piecing, finishing, and blocking. But the frustrating pattern search for a specific item disappears. While the ability to obtain a pattern for any garment opens up doors for users, it complicates the current knitwear design ecosystem. Currently, knitwear design is an artform. Designers pour significant effort into creating and publishing patterns. Some designers even depend on sales of their patterns for their livelihood. Something like Siliki, though not infringing on copyright, would open the door for copycat designs that may jeopardize these sales. Designers may respond negatively by reducing the number of photos in their patterns, or otherwise modify the patterns to reduce the effectiveness of Siliki. Alternatively, designers may respond positively and choose to partner with Siliki. ** For non-knitters, a knitting pattern is a construction recipe for a garment. *** Suggested yarns could be sponsored, leading to a potential additional revenue stream.
