I am Alla Hale, and I would like to welcome you to my W201 Portfolio!  Take a look around, I think you'll enjoy reading about some of my data science ideas.  

I have worked on new product development in several capacities- as an engineer, as a project leader, as an experiment designer, and as a voice-of-customer gatherer.  In my world, new ideas need to solve problems.  The two ideas in this portfolio were born out of problems that I have encountered in my daily life.

### Abstract of Cena {-}


Cena, a digital foodie best friend, creates custom meal plans for you.  Meal plans are created with almost no effort by you and are tailored to your preferences.  Cena even holds your hand at the grocery store because all meal plans come with a shopping list.  Let your culinary adventure begin.  Effortlessly.

(ref:abs1) Hi I'm an abstract for your first big idea! I'm also a [text reference](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#text-references), which is a line of text you can reuse in several places. Use me to write a one paragraph abstract and place it in `index.Rmd` as well as under the title of `01.Rmd`. Once defined, you can reuse me simply by writing `(ref:abs1)` where you want this text to go.

### Abstract of SILIKI {-}

SILIKI, or See It, Like It, Knit It, creates knitting patterns from images of knit garments.  For the non-knitter, a knitting pattern is a construction recipe for an object.  It tells the knitter how many stitches to cast on, how many rows to knit, how shape the fabric, and how to construct the garment.  SILIKI helps the knitter to recreate garments that are spotted out in the wild by providing the knitter with a knitting pattern.
  

(ref:abs2) I'm also an abstract! And a text reference! An abstract is all three acts of your story in a tight little package. You may or may not want to give the ending away, but if you think there's a chance an audience will read this and nothing else, you'd better convey your argument here in miniature. People are busy after all, and there's just so much good tv on the Internet these days.

## About the author {-}

I am interested in the application of data science to new product ideation and development.

I received my bachelor of chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota in 2010.  Previously I held roles with Nitto Denko Technical as a Materials Engineer, Kyocera America, Inc. as a Research and New Product Development Engineer.  Currently, I am working with Hexion as a Design for Six Sigma Black Belt.  Supporting the Epoxy Specialties, Phenolic Specialty Resins, and Oilfield Technology business units, I lead new product and process development projects, driven by strong analysis of data and utilization of six sigma methodologies.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my husband and two small, energetic children, and in addition to hiking, I love playing with sticks and string (i.e. knitting).
