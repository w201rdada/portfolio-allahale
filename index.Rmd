I am Alla Hale, and I would like to welcome you to my W201 Portfolio!  Take a look around, I think you'll enjoy reading about some of my data science ideas.  

I have worked on new product development in several capacities- as an engineer, as a project leader, as an experiment designer, and as a voice-of-customer gatherer.  In my world, new ideas need to solve problems.  The two ideas in this portfolio were born out of problems that I have encountered in my daily life.

### Abstract of SILIKI {-}

(ref:abs2) [SILIKI](https://w201rdada.github.io/portfolio-allahale/Siliki.html), or See It, Like It, Knit It, creates knitting patterns from images of knit garments.  For the non-knitter, a knitting pattern is a construction recipe for an object.  It tells the knitter how many stitches to cast on, how many rows to knit, how shape the fabric, and how to construct the garment.  SILIKI helps the knitter to recreate garments that are spotted out in the wild by providing the knitter with a knitting pattern.

## About the author {-}

I am interested in the application of data science to new product ideation and development.

I received my bachelor of chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota in 2010.  Previously, I held roles with Nitto Denko Technical as a Materials Engineer, Kyocera America, Inc. as a Research and New Product Development Engineer.  Currently, I am with Hexion as a Design for Six Sigma Black Belt.  I lead new product and process development projects, driven by a strong analysis of data and utilization of six sigma methodologies.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my husband and two small, energetic children.  In addition to hiking, I love playing with sticks and string (i.e. knitting).
